# Hubes.Pinger
Ping is a way you can exfiltrate data from a host to a remote host.

My goals for this small project are to:
- Set a project that allows me to exfiltrate a string of data using PING/ICMP
- Be able to run this from the command line and pass in arguments
- Set more complex options
- Setup a listener so that you can play with this from 1 host to another host
